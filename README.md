# Multithreaded FTP Client/Server

## A Brief Description
This project is a java implementation of a multithreaded File Transfer Protocol for Server and Client. The application facilitates file transfer between clients and the server by allowing multiple clients to upload, download or run control commands. Maximum concurrency and mutual exclusion was applied wherever suitable. The project requirements do comply to [RFC 959 Minimum Implementation](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt).
